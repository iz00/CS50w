## About

- [CS50w](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/) (CS50 Web) is a Harvard University's web programming course. It includes fundamental concepts such as front-end and back-end development, and the principles of designing and building dynamic, scalable and secure websites, focusing on good user experience. It also covers practice with languages and tools like HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Javascript and React.

- The course's content is divided in 9 weeks, each composed of a Lecture. There are also the Projects, practical assignments that cover the Lectures' content.

- This repository contains my solutions for some of the Projects.

## Academic Honesty

As per the course's [Policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/honesty/):
> The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Unless otherwise specified, collaboration on assessments (e.g., assignments, labs, problem sets, projects, quizzes, or tests) is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your work to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policyâ€™s other constraints.
